Intent-Aware PhishGuard

Intent-Aware PhishGuard is a browser-based phishing defense system that activates only at the moment a user is about to perform sensitive actions such as login, OTP submission, or payments.

Instead of continuously scanning every page, the system detects user intent, analyzes contextual risk locally, and provides clear, explainable warnings exactly when they matter.

This intent-triggered, privacy-first approach reduces alert fatigue while improving user understanding and real-world phishing prevention.
